## General Information
This projesct is to analyse the demand of shared bikes for a US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes is having a dip in their revenue. In this project the factors affecting the usage of shared bike will be analysed.. Data set is provides by the organization which has below details for 2018 and 2019.
  - instant: record index
	- date
	- season
	- year
	- month
	- holiday 
	- weekday 
	- workingday : if day is neither weekend nor holiday is 1, otherwise is 0.
	- weathersituation
	- emperature in Celsius
	- feeling temperature in Celsius
	- humidity
	- wind speed
	- count of casual users
	- count of registered users
	- count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered

## Technologies Used
   - Python with numpy , pandas, Seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodels, sklearn liraries
   - Linear Regression Concepts
   
## Steps followed
   - Data understanding 
   - Removing unnecessary columns , renaming and also taking care of categorical variables.
   - Divide data into training and test set.
   - Scaling of data
   - Manual method to create the model and also prediction on basis of model.
   - Run the test on Test dataset
   - Analysse the credibility of the test by testing for Error distribution to check whether its normal or not.
   - R2 score
   - RFE Method
   - Applying Manual findings in RFE
   - Run the test on Test dataset for RFE and analysing the credibility of test.
   - Conclusion
   
## Conclusions
- Factors affecting the usage of bike  :
   Temperature
   Seasonal changes
   Snow /Mist Climatic changes
   Working day or not
- Based on the above factors usage of shared bikes will vary.
- Linear regression issues van be solved using Manual or RFE methods. Combining both will be effective.
